# Staging Deployment Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Celery Configuration**
   - Created `celery_worker.py` with Redis connection and task configuration
   - Added task scheduling for daily reports and cleanup operations
   - Updated the Celery start command to use proper CLI arguments

2. **Created Background Tasks**
   - Implemented `monitoring/tasks.py` with Celery tasks
   - Set up task for monitoring execution
   - Created report generation and email sending functionality
   - Implemented cleanup tasks for database maintenance

3. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Added Celery, Flower, and SendGrid to requirements.txt
   - Ensured all dependencies are properly installed

4. **Improved Security**
   - Updated CORS settings to use environment variable instead of wildcard
   - Set up proper security headers and authentication

5. **Created Deployment Documentation**
   - Created `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step instructions
   - Created `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for tracking deployment progress
   - Documented common issues and troubleshooting steps

6. **Added Database Setup Scripts**
   - Created `setup_logs_table.py` for setting up logs and reports tables
   - Configured proper indexes for performance
   - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control

7. **Prepared Frontend for Production**
   - Created `.env.production` for frontend production environment
   - Updated API URL to point to production backend

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend to Render**
   - Create Web Service for the FastAPI backend
   - Set up Redis instance
   - Configure Celery worker and beat services
   - Set all required environment variables

2. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel**
   - Connect repository to Vercel
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy the frontend application

3. **Conduct Post-Deployment Testing**
   - Perform end-to-end testing with test account
   - Verify all functionality works correctly
   - Check logs and monitoring for any issues

4. **Monitor and Optimize**
   - Watch service metrics for performance issues
   - Adjust scaling parameters as needed
   - Fix any issues that arise

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Redis connection issues | Ensure REDIS_URL is correctly set in all services |
| Celery worker failures | Monitor worker logs, implement retry logic |
| Database connection limits | Use connection pooling, monitor connection count |
| API rate limits exceeded | Implement backoff strategies, monitor usage |
| High costs from LLM usage | Set up cost monitoring, implement usage limits |
